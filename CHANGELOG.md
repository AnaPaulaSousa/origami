* **collections:** missing paper-tab selector ([2f3f6a0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/2f3f6a0))

### Features

* **events:** PolymerProperty now works automatically with getters and setters ([6081552](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/6081552)), closes [#6](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/issues/6)
* **templates:** add input to polymer templates to call Angular methods ([79004ec](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/79004ec))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **events:** This allows Angular to set intial property values, which is more natural for when the decorator is used. It does mean that undefined decorated properties may remain undefined even if their Polymer counterpart has a value. The solution is to always set an initial value in Angular for @PolymerProperty properties.
* **events:** PolymerProperty.unwrap() has been removed. Decorate setters with @PolymerProperty() instead of unwrapping the value.
